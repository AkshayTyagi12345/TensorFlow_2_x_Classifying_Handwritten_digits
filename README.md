# TensorFlow_2_x_Classifying_Handwritten_digits
Here  goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of thousands of handwritten images . 
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

In this tutorial we  will be performing the following tasks:
- Prepare the dataset for the model
- Install Tensorflow 2.x
- Develop Single Layer Perceptron model for classifying the handwritten digits
- Plot the change in accuracy per epochs
- Evaluate the model on the testing data
- Analyse the model summary
- Add hidden layer to the model to make it Multi-Layer Perceptron
- Add Dropout to prevent overfitting and check its effect on accuracy
- Increasing the number of Hidden Layer neuron and check its effect on accuracy
- Use different optimizers and check its effect on accuracy
- Increase the hidden layers and check its effect on accuracy
- Manipulate the batch_size and epochs and check its effect on accuracy

- The MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits.
